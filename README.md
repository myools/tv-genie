The information provided helps users find out the schedule of shows, their timezone, network, and summary.  The API returns results for shows globally allowing the user to discover information about shows aired from around the globe.  Using the app is simple, the only requirements is providing a search phrase and pressing the search button.  The API is limited to displaying 10 results at once per search.  The app is designed to work across mobile and desktop viewports.

TECHNOLOGY USED:
TV Genie was designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and the free TVmaze API.  The TV Genie logo was made locally using Adobe Photoshop.
